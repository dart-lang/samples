## Ways you can contribute

- Give us feedback by [filing an issue][issues]
- Fix an issue by [creating a pull request][pull-requests]
- To contribute to the Dart SDK itself, see [this guide][dart-contributing]
instead.

Please do not submit your own samples to this project. If you have a sample you
would like to share, let us know on our [community channels][community].

## Before you contribute

Before we can use your code, you must sign the [Google Individual Contributor
License Agreement](https://cla.developers.google.com/about/google-individual)
(CLA), which you can do online. The CLA is necessary mainly because you own the
copyright to your changes, even after your contribution becomes part of our
codebase, so we need your permission to use and distribute your code. We also
need to be sure of various other things—for instance that you'll tell us if you
know that your code infringes on other people's patents. You don't have to sign
the CLA until after you've submitted your code for review and a member has
approved it, but you must do it before we can put your code into our codebase.

Before you start working on a larger contribution, you should get in touch with
us first through the issue tracker with your idea so that we can help out and
possibly guide you. Coordinating up front makes it much easier to avoid
frustration later on.

## Coding style

The source code in this project follows the:

- [Google C++ style guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
- [Dart style guide](https://dart.dev/guides/language/effective-dart/style)

You should familiarize yourself with those guidelines.

All files in the Dart project must start with the following header. If you add a
new file please also add this. The year should be a single number (not a range;
don't use "2011-2012", even if the original code did).  If you edit an existing
file you don't have to update the year.
