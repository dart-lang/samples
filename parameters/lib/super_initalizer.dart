/// Super-initializer parameters allow to forward constructor parameters
/// to the superclass, avoiding having to write the parameter multiple times
/// in the superclass constructor invocation.

/// This example contains multiple classes representing different types of
/// synthesizers, a musical instrument similar to a piano
/// which can be used to create new sounds.
///
/// All subclasses inherit from the [Synth] class and take advantage of the
/// different super-initializer capabilities.

  /// while [polyphony] and [oscillators] are named parameters.
