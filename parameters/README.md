# Function parameters and super-initializer samples

This sample demonstrates Dart's function parameters capabilities,
including named parameters, optional parameters, and the ability to have named
arguments anywhere in the argument list.

As well, the sample demonstrates super-initializer parameters.

These features are part of Dart 2.17. The programs in this folder won't
compile in earlier versions.
